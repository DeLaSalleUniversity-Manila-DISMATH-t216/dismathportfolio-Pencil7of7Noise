# WEEK 1
- Discrete Mathematics is the study of distinct and countable objects.
- Mathematical proof of a proposition is a chain of logical deductions leading to the preposition from a base set of axioms.
- Prepositions are declarative statements that can either only be true or false.
- Logical Deduction is a process of reasoning from one or more premises to reach a logically certain conclusion.
- Axioms are prepositions that are established, accepted, or self-evidently true.
- Logical Connectives
  1. Negation Operator
  2. Conjunction Operator
  3. Disjunction Operator
  4. Exclusive or Operator
  5. Conditional Operator
  6. Biconditional Operator
- Propositional variables are variables expressing or representing proposition/s.
- Truth Table lists all possible combinations of the input with their corresponding output.
- Bitwise operation uses logical operators one by one.
- Logical expressions are composed of propositional variables with logical connectives.
- I can't believe I still can't remember my favorite quote.

# WEEK 2

  6. Commutative Laws
  7. Associative Laws
  8. De Morgan's Laws
  9. Absorption Laws
- Conversion of a statement reverses the role of the antecedent with the consequent.
- Inverse of a statement negates the original statement.
- Contraposition of a statement is the combination of conversion and inversion, and it is equivalent to the original statment.
- Predicate Logic is when the internal structures of the propositions: subjenct and predicate; are concerned and not the statement as a whole.
- Quantifiers indicate the generality of the open sentences in which a variable occurs.
  1. Universal Quantifiers (for all)
  2. Existential Quantifiers (there exists)
- Counterexamples disprove a universal claim.
- Substitution can't prove a universal claim.

  8. Resolution
- Argument-sequence of statements that end with a conclusion.
- Valid-the conclusion must follow from the truth of the preceding statements of the argument; may either be true or false.
- Fallacy-common form of incorrect reasoning which leads to invalid arguments.
- Tautology-statement that is always true.
- Superman isn't real.
