# WEEK 1
- Discrete Mathematics is the study of distinct and countable objects.
- Mathematical proof of a proposition is a chain of logical deductions leading to the preposition from a base set of axioms.
- Prepositions are declarative statements that can either only be true or false.
- Logical Deduction is a process of reasoning from one or more premises to reach a logically certain conclusion.
- Axioms are prepositions that are established, accepted, or self-evidently true.
- Logical Connectives
  1. Negation Operator
  2. Conjunction Operator
  3. Disjunction Operator
  4. Exclusive or Operator
  5. Conditional Operator
  6. Biconditional Operator
- Propositional variables are variables expressing or representing proposition/s.
- Truth Table lists all possible combinations of the input with their corresponding output.
- Bitwise operation uses logical operators one by one.
- Logical expressions are composed of propositional variables with logical connectives.
- I can't believe I still can't remember my favorite quote.

# WEEK 2

- Logical Equivalences
  1. Identity Laws
  2. Domination Laws
  3. Negation Laws
  4. Double Negation Laws
  5. Idempotent Laws
  6. Commutative Laws
  7. Associative Laws
  8. De Morgan's Laws
  9. Absorption Laws
- Conversion of a statement reverses the role of the antecedent with the consequent.
- Inverse of a statement negates the original statement.
- Contraposition of a statement is the combination of conversion and inversion, and it is equivalent to the original statment.
- Predicate Logic is when the internal structures of the propositions: subjenct and predicate; are concerned and not the statement as a whole.
- Quantifiers indicate the generality of the open sentences in which a variable occurs.
  1. Universal Quantifiers (for all)
  2. Existential Quantifiers (there exists)
- Counterexamples disprove a universal claim.
- Substitution can't prove a universal claim.
- Rules of Inference
  1. Modus Ponens
  2. Modus Tollens
  3. Hypothetical Syllogism
  4. Disjunctive Syllogism
  5. Addition
  6. Simplification
  7. Conjunction
  8. Resolution
- Argument-sequence of statements that end with a conclusion.
- Valid-the conclusion must follow from the truth of the preceding statements of the argument; may either be true or false.
- Fallacy-common form of incorrect reasoning which leads to invalid arguments.
- Tautology-statement that is always true.
- Superman isn't real.

# WEEK 3

- Proof
  - Methods of Proof
    1. Direct Proof
    2. Proof by Contraposition (indirect)
    3. Vacuous & Trivial Proof
    4. Proof by Contradiction (indirect)
- Closure property states that theresult would be part of the same set as its conditions.
